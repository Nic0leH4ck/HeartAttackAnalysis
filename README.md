# Heart Attack Analysis
## Heart Attack Prediction - SQL Project
This project aims to predict the likelihood of a heart attack using a dataset containing various patient attributes.

# Attribute Information
Age: Age of the patient (numeric)
Sex: Gender of the patient (0 = female, 1 = male)
Chest Pain Type (4 values): Type of chest pain experienced by the patient (1 = typical angina, 2 = atypical angina, 3 = non-anginal pain, 4 = asymptomatic)
Resting Blood Pressure: Patientâ€™s resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)
Serum Cholesterol: Serum cholesterol level in mg/dl
Fasting Blood Sugar: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true, 0 = false)
Resting Electrocardiographic Results: Results of resting electrocardiogram (ECG) (0 = normal, 1 = ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy)
Maximum Heart Rate Achieved: Maximum heart rate achieved during exercise
Exercise-Induced Angina: Presence of exercise-induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no)
Oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment (1 = upsloping, 2 = flat, 3 = downsloping)
Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
Thalassemia (Thal): 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversible defect
Target: 0 = less chance of heart attack; 1 = more chance of heart attack

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is available in the attached Excel file. It contains records for several patients, each represented by various attributes.

This project involves performing various SQL queries on the dataset to gain insights and develop predictive models for heart attack likelihood. The data for this project was sourced from a survey published on Kaggle.
